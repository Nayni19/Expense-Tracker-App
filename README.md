# Expense Tracker Application using React Native

An expense tracker app using React Native is an application that helps users keep track of their spending and manage their finances. One useful feature of this app is the ability to total all expenses, providing users with a clear view of their overall spending.

The expense tracker app allows users to enter their expenses, categorize them, and view their spending over time. Users can easily input the amount spent, date, and category of the expense. The app then calculates the total expenses by adding up all the expenses entered by the user.

Users can view their total expenses for a specific time period, such as a month or a week, and also see their expenses by category. This can help users understand their spending habits and identify areas where they may need to cut back.

The app may also include features such as budgeting, data analysis, syncing, and backups to further enhance the user experience. Users can set budgets for specific categories and receive notifications when they are close to exceeding those limits. The data analysis tools help users understand their spending patterns and identify areas for improvement. The syncing and backups features ensure that users' data is always safe and accessible.

Overall, an expense tracker app using React Native that totals all expenses is a valuable tool for individuals or businesses looking to manage their finances. It provides users with an easy way to track their expenses, understand their spending patterns, and make informed financial decisions.
